# Savanna-Simulation
A simulation of a Savanna biome written in Java that simulates the vast amount of species, 
animals that interact with each other as well as real life scenarios and their impact including disease, weather, time and much more! 




The following gif is one example of how the simulation runs (it is a simulation of the ocean, however it is very similar to the Savanna simulation as it was an initial draft before deciding to change to a Savanna ecosystem)
